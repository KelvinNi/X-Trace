Introduction
============
This tutorial is designed to get you started using X-Trace. It will walk through the setup of the backend and the instrumentation of a simple client-server java application.


Setting up X-Trace
==================
1. Download and uncompress the X-trace distribution from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xtraceprj/
2. from inside the uncompressed directory, run bin/backend.sh
3. log into http://localhost:8080 to view the X-Trace backend web interface


Compile and run Client and Server application
=============================================
1. change your current directory to docs/tutorials/lesson1/source/
2. run: javac Client.java
3. run: javac Server.java
4. run: java Client
5. run: java Server
6. Try out sending commands using the client, you should see responses from the server


Instrumenting the communication protocol
========================================
1. Add the X-Trace metadata to the messages our application uses, uncomment the metadata class member which looks like this:
  a. byte[] xtraceMD;


Instrument the Client with X-Trace
==================================
1. Open docs/tutorials/lesson1/source/Client.java, we will be adding (by uncommenting) 7 lines of code to this class...
2. At the beginning of the file, uncomment the following lines of code to import the X-Trace classes we'll use to instrument thei Client class:
  a. import edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceContext;
  b. import edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceMetadata;
3. Setup the trace and first report generation by uncommenting the following line of code at the top of the main() function in the Client class
  a. XTraceContext.startTrace("Client", "Run Tutorial 1" , "tutorial");
4. Uncomment the following two lines of code which are instrumentation points that will be triggered to send X-Trace reports with each message the client sends to the server:
  a. XTraceContext.logEvent("ChatClient", "SendUsersMessage", "Message", msgObjOut.message);
     msgObjOut.xtraceMD = XTraceContext.getThreadContext().pack();
5. Uncoment two more lines of code which are the instrumentation points that will send a report
  a. XTraceContext.setThreadContext(XTraceMetadata.createFromBytes(msgObjIn.xtraceMD,0,16));
     XTraceContext.logEvent("ChatClient", "ReceivedServersMessage");
6. Compile Client.java, you will need to include the location of the x-trace
  a. run: javac -cp path/to/xtrace/dir/lib/xtrace-2.0.jar:. chatapp/Client.java

Instrument the Server with X-Trace
==================================
1. Open docs/tutorials/lesson1/source/Server.java, we will be adding 4 lines of code to this class...
2. At the beginning of the file, uncomment the following lines of code to import the X-Trace classes we'll use to instrument thei Client class:
  a. import edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceContext;
  b. import edu.berkeley.xtrace.XTraceMetadata;
3. Uncomment the following two lines of code which are instrumentation points that will be triggered to send X-Trace reports with each message that is recieved from the client:
  a. XTraceContext.setThreadContext(XTraceMetadata.createFromBytes(msgObjIn.xtraceMD,0,16));
     XTraceContext.logEvent("ChatServer", "ReceivedClientsMessage");
4. Uncoment the two lines of code which are the instrumentation points that will send a report whenever the server replies to the client with a message:
  a. XTraceContext.logEvent("ChatServer", "SendingMessage", "Message", msgObjOut.message);
     msgObjOut.xtraceMD = XTraceContext.getThreadContext().pack();
5. Compile Server.java, you will need to include the location of the x-trace
  a. run: javac -cp path/to/xtrace/dir/lib/xtrace-2.0.jar:. chatapp/server.java


Collect some traces!
====================
1. Run the Server
  a. from within docs/tutorials/tutorial1, run: java -cp path/to/xtrace/dir/lib/xtrace-2.0.jar:. chatapp.Server
2. Run the Client
  a. from within docs/tutorials/tutorial1, run: java -cp path/to/xtrace/dir/lib/xtrace-2.0.jar:. chatapp.Client
3. Try it out, type come messages and see the Server's responses
  
View the X-Trace Graphs
=======================
1. Use a web browser to go to http://localhost:8080 and view the table of traces
2. Click on the "Applet" link under the "Graphs" column of the table of traces to view a graph of your trace
