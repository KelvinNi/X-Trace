Introduction
============
This tutorial is designed to get you started using X-Trace. It will walk through the setup of the backend and the instrumentation of a simple client-server java application.


Setting up X-Trace
==================
1. Download and uncompress the X-trace distribution from http://sourceforge.net/projects/xtraceprj/
2. from inside the uncompressed directory, run bin/backend.sh
3. log into http://localhost:8080 to view the X-Trace backend web interface


Compile and run Client and Server application
=============================================
1. change your current directory to docs/tutorials/lesson1/source/
2. run: javac Client.java
3. run: javac Server.java
4. run: java Client
5. run: java Server
6. Try out sending commands using the client, you should see responses from the server


Instrumenting the Client
========================
1. Open docs/tutorials/lesson1/source/Client.java
2. At the beginning of the file, add a line to import edu.berkeley.xtrace.reporting.*;
3. Setup the trace and first report generation by inserting the following line of code as the first line of the main() function in the Client class
  a. XTraceContext.startTrace("Client", "Run Job: Tutorial 1" , "tutorial");
4. Insert an instrumentation point that will be triggered with each message the client sends to the server
  a.
5. Compile Client.java, you will need to include the location of the x-trace
  a. run: javac -cp path/to/xtrace/dir/lib/xtrace-2.0.jar Client.java

Instrumenting the Server
