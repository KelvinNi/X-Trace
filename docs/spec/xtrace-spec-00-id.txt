.. Note::

   This version of this specification document is 2.1.1, and it specifies
   the X-Trace metadata version 1. The X-Trace metadata version is the
   version number that is encoded in the metadata itself, and is independent
   of the version (2.1.1) of this document.


====================================================================
  Summary
====================================================================
This document describes the X-Trace metadata format version 1, and how it is
encoded in both binary and textual form. It also describes the 
mandatory fields, and the format of optional fields. Separate documents
describe individual options, including how they are represented,
propagated, and how they relate to X-Trace reports.


1. Introduction
====================================================================

X-Trace [1]_ is a framework for tracing the execution of distributed systems.
It provides a logging-like API for the programmer, allowing the recording of
events during the execution. X-Trace records the causal relations among these
events in a deterministic fashion, across threads, software layers, different
machines, and potentially different network layers and administrative domains.
X-Trace groups events, which we also call operations, to tasks. These are sets
of causally related events with a definite start. Events in a task form a
directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each task is given a unique task identifier, and
each event within a task is given an identifier which is unique within the
task.

X-Trace tracks the causal relation among events by propagating a constant-sized
metadata along with the execution, both in messages exchanged by the different
components and within the components themselves. The metadata contains the task
identifier of the current task, and the last event recorded in the current
execution sequence. Each event is reported to a separate reporting
infrastructure, and each report records the identifier of the current event, as
well as the identifier(s) of the event(s) that caused the current event. The
reports contain other information in the form of key/value pairs.  The format
of these reports is described in the accompanying specification [2]_.

The X-Trace metadata has two mandatory components, and a set of optional ones,
described in their own specifications.  The first mandatory component is a
**Task Identifier**, or TaskId, which uniquely identifies a task (in the
context of a reporting infrastructure and during a finite window of time). The
TaskId is the same across all operations comprising a task, and serves the
purpose of identifying all such operations as belonging to the task.  The
second component is called the **Operation Identifier**, or OpID, and should be
unique for each operation or event within the task. The OpID identifies the
operation that generated the metadata, and is used by the subsequent
operation(s) to record the causal relationship between the two operations by
means of reporting. 

There are also optional fields, which may or may not be present, and enhance
the functionality of the X-Trace framework. At the time of this writing, there
are three types of options defined, but more can be added in the future. They
are the Destination option, for specifying where to send reports if not to a
default location; the ChainId option, to explicitly indicate concurrent chains
of events; and the Severity option, that indicates how important it is to
record events related to a particular task.

This document specifies in detail the layout and meaning of the X-Trace
Metadata how it is represented in binary and textual form, and how it is
propagated in the same and between adjacent layers. It does not discuss
reporting in detail, nor how to implement the propagation. It is also beyond
the scope of this document how different protocols include X-Trace Metadata
associated to their respective protocol data units.


2. X-Trace Metadata Binary Representation
====================================================================

The X-Trace Metadata (XTR-Md) is represented in a compact wire format by the
following byte layout.  This layout is used when the XTR-Md is encoded in
binary protocols, as is the case of the encodings of XTR-Md in IP options and
in TCP options. A hexadecimal textual representation of this binary layout is
also used when XTR-Md is encoded in text-based protocols, as is the case of
HTTP and SIP, for example.


     +----------------+---------------------------+
     | Flags:         |         1 byte            |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     | TaskId:        |    4, 8, 12, or 20 bytes  |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     | OpId:          |       4 or 8 bytes        |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     |         Options Block (optional):          |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     | OptionsLen:    |         1 byte            | 
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     |  Options:      |    OptionsLen bytes       |   
     +----------------+---------------------------+

The only mandatory fields are flags, TaskId, and OpId. The other fields are
optional. 

2.1 Flags
--------------------------

There are 8 bits (1 byte) allocated for flags. The bits are
presented here with 7 being the most significant bit and 0 the least
significant bit.

     +---+---+---+---+---------+---------+---+---+
     | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |    3    |    2    | 1 | 0 |
     +===+===+===+===+=========+=========+===+===+
     |               |         |         |       |
     |   Version     | OpIdLen | Options | IdLen | 
     |               |         |         |       |
     +---+---+---+---+---------+---------+---+---+




     +-----+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | Bit | Name            | Description                                                   |
     +=====+=================+===============================================================+
     | 0-1 | IdLen           | Encodes the length of the TaskId                              |
     +-----+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | 2   | Options         | Whether there are option fields present                       |
     +-----+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | 3   | OpIdLen         | If 0, OpIdLen = 4, if 1, OpIdLen = 8                          |
     +-----+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
     | 4-7 | Version         | Encodes the version of the X-Trace Metadata                   |
     +-----+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Bits 0 and 1 encode the length of the TaskId as follows:

   +-------+-------+------------------+
   | IdLen |       |                  |
   +---+---+  Mask | Bytes for TaskId |
   | 1 | 0 |       |                  |
   +===+===+=======+==================+
   | 0 | 0 | 0x00  |       4          | 
   +---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 0 | 1 | 0x01  |       8          |
   +---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 1 | 0 | 0x02  |      12          |
   +---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 1 | 1 | 0x03  |      20          |
   +---+---+-------+------------------+

Bits 4 through 7 encode the version of the metadata as an integer, with 4 being
the least significant bit.  The value 15 (bits 4 through 7 set to 1) is
reserved for future expansion of the version number, if necessary.
**The current version id represented by this spec is 1**.
It is backwards compatible with version 0. The difference
between the two is that version 0 has bit 3 of the flags set
to 0, and only allows OpIds of length 4.

  
   +-------+-------+-------+------------------+
   |    Version    |       |                  |
   +---+---+---+---+  Mask |     Version      |
   | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |       |                  |
   +===+===+===+===+=======+==================+
   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0x00  |       0          | 
   +---+---+---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0x10  |       1          |
   +---+---+---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0x20  |       2          |
   +---+---+---+---+-------+------------------+
   |                 ...                      | 
   +---+---+---+---+-------+------------------+
   | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0xF0  |    reserved      |
   +---+---+---+---+-------+------------------+

   
  
   
2.2 TaskId
---------------------------
The TaskId identifies a Task, or a higher level operation that generally
corresponds to a user-initiated task. It can be composed of several
operations or events that span different software components, nodes, and layers.
As noted above, it can be 4, 8, 12, or 20 bytes long, with the length being
selected by the IdLen bits in the flags field. The TaskId MUST be the same 
across all operations comprinsing a task, or else the operations will not be
associated with the same task.

The set of TaskIds comprised of all 0's is reserved to mean **INVALID**
TaskIds. An X-Trace Metadata with an **INVALID** TaskId is invalid, and
MUST not be propagated or generate reports. 

2.3 OpId
------------------------------
The OpId field identifies each operation or event that is part of a task and needs to be
distinguished from the point of view of the X-Trace framework. It is a 4 or 8 bytes in length,
depending on the setting of the flags bit 3. The value is interpreted as an opaque string of 
bytes, not as a number, and needs to be unique unique within the context of a task. 

If the OpId length is 4 bytes, the version can be set to 0 or 1. The table below
specifies how implementations of versions 0 and 1 of the X-Trace metadata specification
treat the different settings of the OpId length field.

    +-------+--------+------------------+-----------+-----------+
    |Version| OpIdLen| OpId             | Version 0 | Version 1 |
    |       |        |                  |  Impl.    |  Impl.    |
    +=======+========+==================+===========+===========+
    |  0    | 0      |4 bytes           |    ok     |   ok      |
    +-------+--------+------------------+-----------+-----------+
    |  0    | 1      |INVALID METADATA  |   fail    |   fail    |
    +-------+--------+------------------+-----------+-----------+
    |  1    | 0      |4 bytes           |   fail    |   ok      |
    +-------+--------+------------------+-----------+-----------+
    |  1    | 1      |8 bytes           |   fail    |   ok      |
    +-------+--------+------------------+-----------+-----------+
    
If ChainsIds are being used
as options to capture the concurrency structure of a task, then the
OpId needs to be unique only within the context of a ChainId. 

2.4 Metadata Length
--------------------

Given these three mandatory fields, the smallest well-formed X-Trace metadata is 9 bytes long, comprising
the flags field, a 4-byte TaskId, and a 4-byte OpId. As two examples, in hex representation, a well-formed and
valid X-Trace metadata can be 00 01020304 03030303 (with spaces added between the fields for clarity).
The smallest well-formed, invalid X-Trace metadata is 00 00000000 00000000. Note that if the OpId length is
set to 4, the settings of version to 0 or 1 are both valid. 

The maximum size is 1 + 20 + 8 + 1 + 255 = 285 bytes, but so far we have seen very little use of options, 
and no long options have been defined.


2.4 Optional / Extended fields
------------------------------

The option bit in the Flags field indicates the presence of optional or extension fields in the metadata.

2.4.1 Options Length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make determining the size of the XTR-Md easier, there is a Length field that
contains the length of all options combined, in bytes. This length **does not**
include the length field itself. Thus, for determining the total length of an
X-Trace metadata with options, one would add:


   1 (flags) + (length of TaskId) + (length OpId) + 1 (OptionsLen byte) + OptionsLen.

If present, the options length field MUST NOT be set to 0. If there are no
options, the O bit in the Flags field MUST be set to 0.


2.3.1 Option Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following the Options Length field, there may be one or more options. 
Options have a Type field, represented by one byte. 

If the type is 0, it is a **no-option** type.  The option of type 0 has a total
length of 1 byte, and no body.  Option type 0 MAY be used for padding, when it
is more efficient or not possible to include arbitrary-length byte fields in
protocols.  It MUST only occur at the end of the options list. Implementations
MUST NOT try to parse options past the first type 0 option. 

     +--------------------------------------------+ 
     |         No-option option format            |
     +================+===========================+
     |  Type:         |       1 byte (0)          |
     +----------------+---------------------------+

If the option type is not 0, i.e., between 1 and 255, then the option is a
normal option, and follows the option format below:

     +--------------------------------------------+ 
     |            Normal option format            |
     +================+===========================+
     |  Type:         |         1 byte (1-255)    |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     |  Length:       |         1 byte (0-253)*   |
     +----------------+---------------------------+
     |  Payload:      |       Length bytes        |
     +----------------+---------------------------+

The length only includes the size of the payload. Because of the total length
of all options being limited to 255 bytes, the maximum length of each option
can be at most 253 bytes (because of the type and length fields of the option
itself. It there are more than one options, then the maximum length of each
will be correspondingly smaller.

3. X-Trace Metadata Text Representation
====================================================================

For text-based protocols (ASCII, Unicode), like HTTP, SIP, or email, for
example, X-Trace Metadata is represented as a the hexadecimal string of the
successive bytes in the binary representation. The characters A to F SHOULD be
represented in CAPITAL LETTERS, but implementations SHOULD be tolerant to
non-capital letters. Each byte MUST be 0-padded and thus represented by two
characters each.

4. Propagation 
====================================================================

For the propagation of the X-Trace metadata, a node implementation will 
generate a unique OpId and replace the OpId of the previous operation(s)
that happened before the current one. The TaskId MUST remain the same.
So that the graph remains connected, every time a new OpId replaces a 
preceeding one, this binding MUST be registered in a report.

How specific options are propagated will depend on the semantics of each
option. How each option is propagated is part of the option's specification.
However, if an implementation doesn't know how to propagate a specific option,
it MUST copy the option to any new metadata it generates based on the current
one.

Figure 1 below shows an example of a simple HTTP transaction through a proxy
that propagates X-Trace Metadata across layers and operations of the task. In
the figure, (a) represents an OpId, and <T,a> represents metadata with TaskId
T and OpId a. ::
