X-Trace Java Distribution 2.0

Installation

X-Trace is a self-contained package, it doesn't need root or admininstrator
priviledges and doesn't require installing into a system directory. If you want
to make it more easily accessible, or make the proxy run as a service, take a
look at the scripts in bin. The distribution doesn't do this at this point.

1. From svn

If you downloaded X-Trace from the svn repository, you can build it from the
source using ant.  Let <xtrace> be the trunk directory of the repository.

> cd <xtrace>/java
> ant

The distribution is now in <xtrace>/java/build/dist.

You can also build the documentation by doing

> ant javadoc

The javadoc will be in <xtrace>/java/build/dist/docs/api

2. From the release file

If you obtained a release file, x-trace-2.0-<date>.tar.gz or .zip, extract it into your directory of choice.

Dependencies

All of the dependencies to run X-Trace are included in the distribution.
For visualizing the results you will need a recent version of Graphviz.
You will also need to have Java 1.5, ant, Ruby, and Perl.
