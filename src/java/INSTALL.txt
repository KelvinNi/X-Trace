X-Trace Java Distribution 2.1
=============================

X-Trace is a self-contained package; it doesn't need root or admininstrator
privileges and doesn't require installation into a system directory. If you
want to make it more easily accessible or make the proxy run as a service, take
a look at the scripts in bin. The distribution doesn't do this at this point.

From GitHub
-----------

If you downloaded X-Trace from GitHub, you can build it from the source using
Maven. Let <xtrace> be the directory of the repository.

$ cd <xtrace>/src/java
$ mvn package

The JAR will be generated in <xtrace>/java/src/target. Yyou can now run the
X-Trace backend (check that you have all necessary dependencies, see
Dependencies below).

$ cd <xtrace>/src/java
$ bin/backend.sh

You can also build the documentation with:

$ mvn site

The documentation will be in <xtrace>/src/java/target/site.

From the release file
---------------------

If you obtained a release file, x-trace-2.0-<date>.tar.gz or .zip, extract it
to your directory of choice (which we'll call <xtrace> for our example below).
Run the backend with the following:

$ bin/backend.sh

Once the backend is running, the X-Trace reporting interface can be accessed by
visiting http://localhost:8080.

Dependencies
------------

All of the dependencies to run X-Trace are included in the distribution. For
visualizing the results you will need a recent version of Graphviz. You will
also need to have Java 1.5, Maven, Ruby, and Perl.
