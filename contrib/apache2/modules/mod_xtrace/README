X-Trace Apache module

Rodrigo Fonseca

This is still experimental. Not part of release. Not ready for use.
Tested on: apache 2.2.9 on linux, 
           gcc version 4.3.1 20080708 (Red Hat 4.3.1-4) (GCC)

Todo:
Correcly handle case when X-Trace metadata is changed between start and end
 - Test with CGI, mod_perl, mod_php, mod_proxy
Add configuration parameters
 - per directory frequency of X-trace generation
 - whether to log or just add X-Trace metadata
 - url to see the X-Trace report, to be sent to client
 - size of X-Trace taskId generated (4, 8, 12, or 20 bytes)
 - size of X-Trace opId generated (4 or 8 bytes)
